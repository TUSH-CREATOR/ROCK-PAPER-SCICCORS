# ROCK-PAPER-SCICCORS
RPS
rock paper scissors is a hand game for two or more players. Participants say “rock, paper, scissors” and then simultaneously form their hands into the shape of a rock (a fist), a piece of paper (palm facing downward), or a pair of scissors (two fingers extended). The rules are straightforward: Rock smashes scissors.
